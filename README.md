# Vuepress site deployed to github pages 

This is a test to try and figure out how to deploy effectively to github pages using vuepress

## What I learned
tl;dr vuepress kinda sucks

I tried using vuepress for about 2-3 hours and I ran into a myriad of issues that made me switch off of it.

### Lack of documentation
Docs are actually really lacking. It describes a quickstart, and a reference for the configuration. That's pretty much it. Also, it's inconsistent. Getting started with vue requires you to follow a combination of instructions from different parts of the docs. The scaffolded project doesn't adhere to the recommended archetecture, etc. 

### Lack of community
Vuepress just seems like a dead framework. 60% of users are chinese, and even then there aren't that many people using it or trying to get it to work. Just can't find any good resources.

### Inconsistencies with running project
If you expect `vuepress build` to work because `vuepress dev` worked, you're wrong. To this day I have no idea why I couldn't get it to work, but I'm done trying to figure it out

## What next?
Gonna try nuxt.js
